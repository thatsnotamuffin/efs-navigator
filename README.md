# EFS Navigator
A lightweight web-based interface for exploring AWS EFS Access Points.

EFS Navigator lets you securely browse, view, and download files stored on Amazon EFS through its Access Points — all without needing to mount the file system directly. With support for syntax highlighting of common file types (YAML, Python, Bash, and more), it’s a handy tool for DevOps engineers and platform teams working with shared cloud storage.
